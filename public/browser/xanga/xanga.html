  <h1>The Beginning: Xanga</h1>
  <p>
      In the Golden Age of 2001, when Backstreet Boys were king, WWE was still WWF, and Goku was still fighting Cell: I started my first Xanga account. I finally had a space of my own, and I learned quickly that it was totally customizable. I spent hours, creating and recreating my page. Brooklyn Kid font, Ignition the Remix upon loading, a lot of Dragon Ball Z pictures, and as many eProps as I could get my friends to <q>hit me back</q> with. I could talk about how basketball was that day, or I could blogosophize about how inconsiderate it was to only leave one eProp on someone&#8217;s post. There obviously wasn&#8217;t anything groundbreaking happening on xanga.com/slomo3, but for better or worse, at that time I lived for the moments I could tinker with my site.
